# Formal Languages and Translators

This repository contains the exercises I developed throughout the university course regarding formal languages and translators.

It contains a translator from a fictional language to java bytecode.

To run this you should download [jasmin](http://jasmin.sourceforge.net/) and save it in this project's root folder (after you cloned it).
